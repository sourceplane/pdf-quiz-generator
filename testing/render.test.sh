# python3 with no third-party packages (and again with the system python3,
# when it has PyYAML), and checks the record it writes: the workspace read
# from intent.yaml, the app's Workers, a probe row per URL (no such Worker
# exists, so whatever answers — nothing offline, workers.dev's 404 online —
# the content check says it is not the app's page), the optional Google key
# secret named, and the README's live-deployment section.

# Needs: bash, python3 (with venv), curl. The network is optional.
